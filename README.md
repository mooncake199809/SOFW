# Official Code for SOFW
This is the official code for our paper "SOFW: A Synergistic Optimization Framework for Indoor 3D Object Detection"
![comparison](https://github.com/mooncake199809/SOFW/blob/main/docs/overall.png)

In this work, we propose SOFW, a synergistic optimization framework that investigates the feasibility of optimizing 3D object detection tasks concurrently spanning several dataset domains.
The core of SOFW is identifying domain-shared parameters to encode universal scene attributes, while employing domain-specific parameters to delve into the particularities of each scene domain. 


# Main Results
In this work, we conduct 3D object detection task on S3DIS, ScanNet, and SUN RGB-D dataset.
